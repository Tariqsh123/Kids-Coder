            <h1>1. End Customer License Agreement</h1><br><br>
            <p>This End Customer License Agreement (“License Agreement”) was executed, signed and took effect on Customer’s execution (“Effective Date”) by and between Kids Coder, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 530 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10036 (“Kids Coder”) and Customer identified in the Statement of Work (“Customer”).</p>
            <p>Customer and Kids Coder shall be hereinafter individually referred to as “Party” and collectively as “Parties”.</p>
            <p>If the Customer acquires Services (as defined below) under the terms specified herein through a Partner (as defined below), this License Agreement will take precedence over any conflicting terms in the agreement between the Customer and the Partner, insofar as the relationship between the Customer and Kids Coder is concerned. Rights granted to the Customer in a separate agreement with the Partner, which are absent in this License Agreement, are applicable exclusively in the context of that Partner. Consequently, the Customer is obliged to pursue any remedies or enforcement of such rights solely with the Partner and not Kids Coder.</p>
            <p>BY SIGNING A STATEMENT OF WORK, ACCESSING, RECEIVING, AND/OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. IN NO EVENT MAY YOU ACCESS, RECEIVE OR OTHERWISE USE ANY Kids Coder PRODUCT OR SERVICE WITHOUT AGREEING TO THESE TERMS (OR ANOTHER AGREEMENT AGREED TO IN WRITING BY Kids Coder).</p>

            <p>13. <span> “Subscription” </span>refers to a non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable right to use the Services and the output of the Services in accordance with this License Agreement and the Statement of Work (SOW) within the Customer’s relevant facilities, as detailed in the SOW. </p>
            <p>14. <span> “Subscription Start Date”</span>  refers to the date on which the Services commence, as specified in the relevant Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
